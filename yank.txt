(There is a )
There is a place where the sidewalk ends
"And before the "
And before the street begins,
{And there }
And there the grass grows soft and white,
[And there the ]
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
'And there '
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
<To >
To cool in the peppermint wind.

"Let "
Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
[And ]
And the dark street winds and bends.
'Past the pits '
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
(We shall walk )
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
<And watch where >
And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
{To the place }
To the place where the sidewalk ends.

[Yes we'll walk ] 
Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
"And we'll go where "
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
{For the children}
For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
'The place where '
The place where the sidewalk ends.
