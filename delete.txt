Nearer he strode then, the stout-hearted warrior 
Snatched as he slumbered, seizing with hand-grip,
Forward the foeman foined with his hand; 
Caught he quickly the cunning deviser,
On his elbow he rested. This early discovered
The master of malice, that in middle-earths regions,
Neath the whole of the heavens, no hand-grapple greater
In any man else had he ever encountered:
Fearful in spirit, faint-mooded waxed he,
Not off could betake him; death he was pondering,
Would fly to his covert, seek the devils assembly:
His calling no more was the same he had followed
Long in his lifetime. The liege-kinsman worthy
Of Higelac minded his speech of the evening,
Stood he up straight and stoutly did seize him.
